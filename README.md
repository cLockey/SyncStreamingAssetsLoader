# SyncStreamingAssetsLoader

If you want to load files from StreamingAssets path in Unity, You can only load from WWW class in Android device.
So, I've made the sync loader.

1) Instantiate SyncStreamingAssetsLoader;
2) Invoke Init function
3) Load streaming assets files.

You can see my sample code from Sample.cs
